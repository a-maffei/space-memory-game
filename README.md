# Memory Game in Space

A classic memory game: you get presented with a set of cards of even number and your mission is to find couples of matching images. The pictures all come from space âœ¨

Building this game was an opportunity to practice first-hand and learn more about:
- Working with an external API (Pexels), which required to use authorization headers 
- Passing props, ensuring they are the right ones by using propTypes
- Implementing React hooks, including creating custom ones  
- Building flexible and reusable React components
