# Memory Game in Space

A classic memory game: you get presented with a set of cards of even number and your mission is to find couples of matching images. The pictures all come from space (and from the Pexels photo API) ✨

Building this game (as a week-long side project during my bootcamp) was an opportunity to practice first-hand and learn more about:
- Working with an external API, which also required to use authorization headers 
- Passing props, ensuring they are the right ones by using propTypes
- Implementing React hooks, including creating custom ones  
- Building flexible and reusable React components
